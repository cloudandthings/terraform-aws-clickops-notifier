## üöô Test Drive

Head to the AWS Console and go Serverless Application Repository. Search for Clickops in the Public Applications. Select the ClickOps application and complete the Application Settings.

The Serverless App will deploy the following resources below:

- `Custom S3BucketConfiguration` and `Lambda Function`: The custom configuration invokes a lambda with parameters needed to create a bucket notification policy which the ClicksOps lambda filters through to determine the events associated with resources being modified in the console
- `SQS Queue`	and `SQS QueuePolicy`: The bucket notification places those events on an SQS queue which the ClickOps Lambda consumes
- `Lambda Function`: The ClickOps Lambda
- `Logs LogGroup`: The ClickOps Lambda Log Group
- `SSM Parameter`: The SSM parameter used to store the Slack WebHook URL

Once the Application is deployed tune into the Slack Channel you set to notify and marvel in watching those non-IAAC gremlins make changes in the Console.
